            <li>
           <p style="font-size: 135%;">With over seventy some years of research to back it up, entrainment is now a pure rationale of modern
                    physics. The first appearance of this process was documented in 1656 by a Dutch Scientist named Christian
                    Huygens who witnessed the phenomena of synchronization during an experiment with clocks.
                    While Christian Huygens was designing a pendulum clock, he had an idea, a hunch if you will, to place
                    two unsynchronized clocks right next to each other while hanging on a wall and see what would happen.
                    Low and behold they slowly starting ticking at the same frequency in time, or synchronizing naturally with
                    each other. The synchronization process was so accurate that they could not be calibrated more accurately if there were a mechanical interference to fix them. Synchronization exists in other parts of systems
                    throughout the universe. </p>  </li>   </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 135%;">This synchronization is a deep, significant principle that resonates everywhere and within everything, including your brain which has a tendency to change the flow of its brainwave frequencies when exposed to

            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
            <p style="font-size: 135%;">First identified and introduced to modern science in 1934, brainwave entrainment has been around much
                longer than that. The great mathematician, astronomer, geographer and astrologer Claudius Ptolemaeus,
                known to modern English as Ptolemy, pondered about such ideas around A.D. 85-165. During his life,
                Ptolemy made numerous observations involving entrainment principles, such as the intense feeling of
                euphoria that would seize the conscious mind when he gazed at the sun through the pokes of a spinning
                wheel.</p>
        </div>




        <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
            <p style="font-size: 135%;">In 1929 Hans Berger discovered something called the alpha brainwave, one of the five categories of brain
                frequency, which also includes beta waves, gamma waves, delta waves and theta waves. Between 7-14
                Hertz, alpha waves are some of the more mysterious frequencies of the spectrum. An alpha wave state is a
                sort of connector between the unconscious waves of theta (a dream state) and the fully conscious and alert
                state of beta waves. Alpha waves are simply put, your minds subconscious frequency. Often confused
                with the unconscious, which means either asleep or the lack of consciousness, the subconscious is rather
                the thoughts that are processed without thinking. Ideas, daydreaming, intuition, hunches, they all fall
                under what is often referred to as the lightly hypnotic state of sub-consciousness. Researchers have found
                over the years more and more information about how the strength of this alpha wave can be stretched beyond its natural frequency to assist in creative and behaviour modification tasks.</p>
        </div>



        <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
            <p style="font-size: 135%;">In the early 20th century, scientists started using tools such as flickering lights in a method called Photic
                Driving. One of the first methods of Brainwave Entrainment to be studies by the scientific community was
                via light stimulation. In the following years more scientists expanded on the research and discovered that
                not only light but tactile stimulation in a repetitive and rhythmic way could also produce this entrainment
                or synchronization effect.</p>
        </div>



        <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
            <p style="font-size: 135%;">After a lot of research and time had been spent in labs and experimental facilities, by the 1960’s, it was
                at this time that Anesthesiologist M.S. Sadove began using photic stimulation as a method to reduce the
                amount of anesthetic a patient would need before surgery. Fellow doctors and scientists were beginning to
                see entrainment as a concrete factual tool rather than a mere scientific phenomenon and curiosity. </p>
        </div>



        <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
            <p style="font-size: 135%;">Around the same time an article was published by Bernard Margolis about the effectiveness of using brainwave entrainment in dentistry. He noted that when using this technique fewer anesthesia were required and
                the patients benefitted from reduced anxiety and nervousness along with less gagging and bleeding during
                procedures. These accounts are just some of the many ways doctors were beginning to see the role a person’s brain could play during the treatment and healing process.</p>
        </div>



        <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
            <p style="font-size: 135%;">Later in the early 1970’s these specific methods were fully elaborated by Dr. Gerald Oster who wrote in
                an issue of Scientific American about how combining two vestal tones would result in a rhythmical beat
                which he named the Binaural. Binaural beats are a well-known form of auditory responses from your brain
                which arise from the nucleus of each of the brain’s two hemispheres and are triggered by two sounds below
                1000 Hz originating in either ear simultaneously. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
            <p style="font-size: 135%;">A decade later people like Dr. Norman Shealy and Dr. Glen Solomon began exploring entrainment for the
                possible treatment of headaches. Other searchers wanted to know whether this brain entrainment effect
                could also help with general relaxation and stress-relief. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
            <p style="font-size: 135%;">In 1981 the first self help book came out about the uses of entrainment; it was called MegaBrain, and was
                written by Michael Hutchison. It outlined a variety of ways a person could use entrainment for superior
                learning and meditation. At this same time across the world, affiliates at the Department of Neuropsychiatry in Osaka Japan ascertained that photic stimulation would produce a cerebral synchronization in many
                subjects. This was later confirmed by Dr. Shealy in America by a separate study of over 5000 patients.
                Through out the 1990’s more studies were conducted on the vast areas in which brain entrainment could
                be applied to help with learning disorders and such other conditions as ADD, Chronic Pain, Depression,
                Fatigue, and Hypertension. </p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Marvels of Modern Use</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 135%;">In recent times, brainwave entrainment is most often used in self help or as a medical treatment for a variety of ailments. Brainwave entrainment can help you intellectually by increasing your mental ability and
giving you a greater, faster thinking capability to solve problems or creative tasks faster. It can literally
increase your IQ over time as you begin to store and access memories more efficiently and learn to rely
more on your subconscious level which makes processing information much more intuitive. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
        <p style="font-size: 135%;">Some people believe that this sort of intuition or creativity can only be born with as a gift rather than a
skill that can be learned or a behavior that can be implemented in life by subconscious means. Some
people are born with more intuition or creativity than others, this is most likely because this area of their
brain is more developed and they have learned to use it where others have not, but it doesn’t mean this gift
should be exclusive to them. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
        <p style="font-size: 135%;">You can also experience with the effects of certain forms of brainwave entrainment what is called wholebrain thinking by synchronizing your entire mind to think as one great assemblage instead of using the
right and left hemispheres as you usually would. Brainwave Entrainment can help you learn to make better decisions and develop stronger mind that will be more capable of handling every aspect of your life.
This whole-brain thinking proficiency attempts to combine those two very different areas of your brain and
have them operate together instead of in dissimilar contexts as they perform unalike functions as they do
currently. The left hemisphere is a more logical side, a detail-oriented area that helps you make decisions
or take a test. However, the right side of the brain is more imaginative and is more prone to whole images
and patterns. </p>
    </div>


    <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
        <p style="font-size: 135%;">Since the left brain is far more stimulated and encouraged in both school years and later in most places of
employment we are taught to think in that way, even those of us that are primarily right-brained individuals to begin with. What we need to attain a level of whole brain thinking is to start to train our minds to
implement our right brain into those daily activities by way of brainwave entrainment. Once you being to
do this, you will notice the character of your life has been heightened greatly in the way that all the new
sights and smells of the environment around you are inspirational and uplifting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
        <p style="font-size: 135%;">Another amazing area that brainwave entrainment can completely transforms is the area of stress, worry
and pessimism. First the rhythm of the entrainment will help you enjoy a greater sense of relaxation and
help make those feelings of stress and tension slowly ease and finally vanish into thin air. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
        <p style="font-size: 135%;">Brainwave entrainment provides you with a unique area in which you know you are able to relax and just
float away to the music or messages and convert your feelings of helplessness into ones of control and
calm. You can begin to then enjoy a renewed sense of positivity and focus on the wonderful area of your
life. The flow of these feelings will just take you away into a place with more energy and increased optimism.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
        <p style="font-size: 135%;">Conquering your emotions is another great brainwave entrainment goal that can be realized through as
little as just a few sessions. Everyone would love to enjoy a happier life and erasing those feelings that
hold you back, those unhappy memories was never easier to get rid of than with this amazing method. You
can start to feel more peaceful and even help master your depression with some of the modern brainwave
entrainment methods</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col s8 offset-s1">

    </div>

    <div class="col s8 offset-s1">
        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;"></h4>
        <p style="font-size: 135%;">In the last few years, a great number of advancements in using brainwave entrainment in the actual field
of treating people for problems have taken place. Especially in how this method associates cognitive or
learning functions in the minds of people. It has been proven in studies that some are, in reality functioning at low capacity. Using the entrainment techniques focused on a certain area of a person’s brain they can
actually help them to increase their concentration and energy therefore helping to improve and individual’s
performance academically.</p>
