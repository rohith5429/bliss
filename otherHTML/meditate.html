                Meditation can have a wide range of benefits,
                but there are also some potential pitfalls to watch for.
                As you are starting a new meditation habit, it can be easy to expect too much too quickly.
                The reality is that it takes time and practice to build a habit that can have a positive
                impact on your health and well-being.

                        <h2>Focused Meditation</h2>
                        <p>
                            Focused meditation involves focusing on something intently as a way of staying
                            in the present moment and slowing down the inner dialogue.
                            Unlike classic meditation, where you focus on nothing to quiet your mind, with focused meditation, you still remain
                            in the present, but focus wholly on one thing. Typically, you focus on sensory stimuli like sounds, visual items, tactile
                            sensations, tastes, smells, and even your own Blissing—much like mindfulness meditation techniques.<br>
                            <br><h5>Benefits </h5><br>
                            Once you learn that you can stay present regardless of
                             what you're feeling, you can find ease and comfort amidst even the toughest emotions.

                            <strong>Mindfulness improves mental health.</strong>
                            In recent years, psychotherapists have turned to mindfulness meditation as an important element in the treatment of a number of problems, including: depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, couples’ conflicts, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Mindfulness improves well-being. </strong>
                            Increasing your capacity for mindfulness supports many attitudes that contribute to a satisfied life. Being mindful makes it easier to savor the pleasures in life as they occur, helps you become fully engaged in activities, and creates a greater capacity to deal with adverse events. By focusing on the here and now, many people who practice mindfulness find that they are less likely to get caught up in worries about the future or regrets over the past, are less preoccupied with concerns about success and self-esteem, and are better able to form deep connections with others.

                        <h2>Chakra Healing Meditation</h2>
                        <p>
                        Chakra meditation is a blanket term for any type of meditation that seeks to clear blocked chakras and harness the power of these energy centers located throughout the body. They can be used for everything from promoting calm and relaxation to encouraging spiritual awakening (note that those meditations devoted to spiritual awakening should be guided by a certified teacher—not a YouTube video). Basically, if your goal is to feel more balanced or relaxed, or even just to have an easier time falling asleep, a self-monitored practice should suffice. If your intentions are a little deeper, your best bet is to learn from the pros.
                              <br><br>

                            Studies using MRI scans and other brain imaging technology have shown that people who
                            regularly did yoga had a thicker cerebral cortex (the area of the brain responsible for
                             information processing) and hippocampus (the area of the brain involved in learn­ing and
                             memory) compared with nonpractitioners. These areas of the brain typically shrink as you
                             age, but the older yoga practitioners showed less shrinkage than those who did no yoga.
                             This suggests that yoga may counteract age-related declines in memory and other cognitive
                              skills.

                            Isochronic tones are single tones that come on and off at regular, evenly spaced intervals. This interval is typically brief, creating a beat that’s like a rhythmic pulse. They’re often embedded in other sounds, such as music or nature sounds.
                            <br>Isochronic tones are used for brain wave entrainment, in which your brain waves are made to sync with the frequency that you’re listening to. It’s believed that syncing your brain waves to a certain frequency might be able to induce various mental states.<br>
                        Brain waves are produced by electrical activity in the brain. They can be measured using a technique called an electroencephalogram (EEG).
                        <br>There are several recognized types of brain waves. Each type is associated with a frequency range and a mental state. Listed in order from highest frequency to lowest, five common types are:
